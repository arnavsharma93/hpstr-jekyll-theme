I have been associated with Sahana Software Foundation since October, 2013, first as a volunteer contributor, then as a SSF intern for four months and since April as a GSoC intern.

Sahana Software Foundation held its SahanaCamp and Sahana Conference in conjunction with the  Indian Ocean Tsunami 10th (IOTX) Anniversary convention in Colombo, Sri Lanka from 18<sup>th</sup>-22<sup>nd</sup> June. So, when Micheal (recently appointed the CEO of SSF, then the director) sent out an invitation mail to the community for the events, I was quick to accept it. Luckily, Google being the big hearted corporate it is, decided to fund our (all GSoC interns) travel, accomodation and food. Thus, we (I, Somay, Mayank, Arnav A., Gaurav and Hemant) were all ready to go except for Ambar who could not come.

Our week began on 15<sup>th</sup> of June when we had the Sahana Strategic Planning Session. It was there where we met other community members like Fran Boon, Dominic KÃ¶nig, Micheal Howden, Ramindu Deshapriya, Chamindra de Silva, Nuwan Waidyanatha, Louiqa Raschid and others. It was fascinating to meet and spend some good time with them.

Our normal schedule was to report at the venue (Virtusa) at 9:30 (we were always running late. Why?), work till 6 and then party for the rest of the evening and night (that's why). The work was blissful. We were as involved in the discussion as any other member who has been working with Sahana since it's inception. That is another plus of contributing to FOSS, that your views get heard and hold value (as long as they have any).


### What I did?

* Gave a demonstration on [Timor-Leste Disaster Information System](http://demo.drm.tl/),
* Learnt about Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
* Squished a bug with Dominic in the CAP codefest
* Participated in the Sahana BarCamp & Sahana Strategic Planning Session
* Gave a session in the BarCamp on my GSoC project

### What I learnt?

Overall, I learnt about Sahana, its history, its deployments, its members and its aims and objectives. Also, I gained more clarity about the future path and aim of my GSoC project, mostly because of Dominic. The BarCamp sessions about debugging, deployments and other GSoC projects were insightful.

FOSS is nothing but a few people with a common goal working together for the betterment of a community by developing software. This, I saw in person and this will stick with me for the rest of my life.
