## Who am I?


TBH, IDK.

I am [Arnav Sharma](http://web.iiit.ac.in/~arnav.s/), currently studying in [IIIT-H](http://iiit.ac.in/) and living in Hyderabad. I am passionate about developing new things, contributing to FOSS and traveling. I am currently a [GSoC](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) intern with [Sahana Software Foundation](http://sahanafoundation.org/) and doing research on parsing natural languages at [LTRC](http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/).


My father, **Col. A. K. Sharma**, is an Army officer. Hence, I am a fauji brat (as we like to call ourselves).  My mother, **Ms. Sonia Sharma**, is a high school English teacher. I have an awesome brother, **Varun Sharma**, who lives in New York and works at LinkedIn. I have spent my childhood in cantonments like Umroi in Meghalya, Ambala in Haryana, Fatehgarh & Mathura in Uttar Pradesh and Amritsar & Jalandhar in Punjab.
